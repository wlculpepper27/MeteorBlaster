Introduction:

This programming assignment requires you to 
create the classes that will eventually be used to 
form the graphical objects in the Meteor Blaster 
game animation. The focus of this assignment is 
the inheritance and aggregation relationships 
between the classes. You will not produce a 
playable game.  See the pdf file for the full project details.

The new file "UML Addendum.pdf" has information about classes that have been implemented for you in
the mbsupport.jar library.  You can find an example of how to create Craft and Meteor objects in the file src/GamePane.java.
